Q1: Write 2 python function to get the indices of the sorted elements of given lists and compare the speed. one is without numpy package and the other is with numpy. (raise a error message if the input is null or not numerical) -- 13pt

List 1: [23, 104, 5, 190, 8, 7, -3]
List 2 : []
List 3 : random generate 1000000 integers 


Q2: Do the following exercise in a Jupyter Notebook (a GitHub Link would be the best): -- 12pt

Load the countries.csv directly via URL import into your panda data frame!
Display descriptive statistics for the numerical column (count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max) HINT: describe
Show the last 4 rows of the data frame.
Show all the rows of countries that have the EURO
Show only name and Currency in a new data frame
Show only the rows/countries that have more than 2000 GDP (it is in Milliarden USD Bruttoinlandsprodukt)
Select all countries where with inhabitants between 50 and 150 Mio
Calculate the GDP average (ignore the missing value)
Calculate the GDP average (missing value treated as 0)
Calculate the population density (population/area)  of all countries and add as new column
Sort by country name alphabetically
Create a new data frame from the original where the area is changed: all countries with > 1000000 get BIG and <= 1000000 get SMALL in the cell replaced!
